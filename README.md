## Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Jacob Hall
### Introduction
I am a student at Fort Hays Tech | Northwest, working hard to refine my skills in full-stack application and web development. I can manage teams in high pressure work environments. I have a Swift Associate Certification and take pride in my skills with front-end design. I am interested in building websites and applications, and eventually start building video games!
